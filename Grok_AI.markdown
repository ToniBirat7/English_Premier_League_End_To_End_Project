# End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline Architecture

## Overview
This architecture outlines the machine learning pipeline for a football updates web application. The pipeline is designed to collect data from APIs and web scraping, store it efficiently, process it for model training, deploy predictive models, and monitor their performance. The focus is on scalability, maintainability, and production-readiness, using modern tools and cloud infrastructure.

## Pipeline Stages
1. **Data Ingestion**: Collecting data from external sources.
2. **Data Storage**: Storing raw and processed data.
3. **Data Processing**: Cleaning and transforming data for modeling.
4. **Model Training**: Training machine learning models.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance.
6. **Model Deployment**: Serving models for predictions.
7. **Model Monitoring**: Tracking and maintaining model performance.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS (S3, EKS, RDS, ElastiCache)
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Apache Airflow
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes (AWS EKS)
- **Data Storage**: AWS S3 (raw data), MariaDB (processed data), Redis (caching)
- **Machine Learning Management**: MLflow
- **Data Version Control**: DVC
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Data Interchange**: Apache Arrow

## Detailed Pipeline Flow

### 1. Data Ingestion
- **Objective**: Collect football-related data periodically.
- **Sources**: 
  - APIs (e.g., football stats APIs).
  - Web scraping (e.g., news, odds from betting platforms).
  - Initial dataset: [Kaggle English Premier League](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saife245/english-premier-league/data).
- **Implementation**:
  - Python scripts using `requests` for APIs and `BeautifulSoup` or `Scrapy` for scraping.
  - Scheduled via Apache Airflow DAGs (e.g., daily or weekly runs).
  - Scripts run inside Docker containers for consistency.
- **Output**: Raw data stored in AWS S3 buckets.

### 2. Data Storage
- **Raw Data**: 
  - Stored in AWS S3 for scalability and durability.
  - Organized by source and timestamp (e.g., `s3://football-data/raw/api/2023-10-01/`).
- **Processed Data**: 
  - Stored in MariaDB (via AWS RDS) for structured data like team stats, player stats, and match results.
  - Schema designed for efficient querying (e.g., tables for teams, players, matches).
- **Caching**: 
  - Redis (via AWS ElastiCache) caches frequently accessed data (e.g., latest stats) to reduce database load.

### 3. Data Processing
- **Objective**: Transform raw data into model-ready features.
- **Implementation**:
  - Airflow triggers Docker containers running Python scripts.
  - Libraries: Pandas for small datasets, Dask for larger ones.
  - Steps: Handle missing values, normalize stats, engineer features (e.g., player form, team win streaks).
  - Apache Arrow used for efficient data transfer between components.
- **Input**: Raw data from S3.
- **Output**: Processed data stored in MariaDB.

### 4. Model Training
- **Objective**: Train models to predict match outcomes, player performance, and goals.
- **Implementation**:
  - Airflow schedules training jobs in Docker containers.
  - Frameworks: Scikit-learn for simpler models, TensorFlow/PyTorch for complex ones.
  - Data: Processed data from MariaDB or S3.
  - MLflow tracks experiments (parameters, metrics, artifacts) and stores models in S3.
  - DVC versions training data and models alongside code (Git).
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes pods on AWS EKS, with potential GPU support for larger models.

### 5. Model Evaluation
- **Objective**: Assess model quality before deployment.
- **Implementation**:
  - Integrated into training scripts or run as separate Airflow tasks.
  - Metrics (e.g., accuracy, RMSE) logged with MLflow.
  - Validation using holdout sets or cross-validation.
- **Outcome**: If performance meets thresholds, model is registered in MLflow’s model registry.

### 6. Model Deployment
- **Objective**: Serve predictions for upcoming matches and player stats.
- **Implementation**:
  - Registered models deployed via MLflow’s serving tools or as REST APIs (e.g., Flask/FastAPI).
  - Containerized and deployed on Kubernetes (AWS EKS).
  - API endpoints exposed for predictions (e.g., `/predict/match`, `/predict/player`).
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes auto-scales pods based on demand.

### 7. Model Monitoring
- **Objective**: Ensure model performance over time.
- **Implementation**:
  - Prometheus scrapes metrics from deployed models (e.g., prediction latency, accuracy).
  - Grafana dashboards visualize performance and trends.
  - Alerts trigger retraining (via Airflow) if data drift or performance degradation is detected.
- **Retraining**: New data ingested and processed, model retrained and redeployed as needed.

## Tool Interactions
- **Airflow**: Orchestrates the pipeline, scheduling ingestion, processing, training, and monitoring tasks.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments for all pipeline components.
- **Kubernetes**: Manages container deployment and scaling on AWS EKS.
- **AWS S3**: Stores raw data and MLflow artifacts.
- **MariaDB (RDS)**: Holds processed, structured data.
- **Redis (ElastiCache)**: Speeds up data access with caching.
- **MLflow**: Manages experiment tracking, model registry, and deployment.
- **DVC**: Tracks data and model versions, integrated with Git.
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: Monitors deployed models and triggers alerts.
- **Arrow**: Optimizes data movement between pipeline stages.

## High-Level Architecture Flow
1. **Data Ingestion**: Airflow → Docker → APIs/Scraping → S3.
2. **Data Processing**: Airflow → Docker → S3 → Processing → MariaDB.
3. **Model Training**: Airflow → Docker → MariaDB/S3 → MLflow → S3 (artifacts).
4. **Model Deployment**: MLflow → Docker → Kubernetes → API.
5. **Monitoring**: Prometheus → Grafana → Airflow (retraining).

## Future Considerations
- Integration with the web app’s backend for real-time predictions.
- Scaling storage and compute as data and user demand grow.
- Enhancing monitoring with automated drift detection and retraining workflows.

This pipeline provides a robust foundation for the first phase, ensuring data flows seamlessly from collection to actionable predictions while leveraging the specified tools effectively.
