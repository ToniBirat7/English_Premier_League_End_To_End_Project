Great, I’ll create a detailed architecture plan for your real-time machine learning pipeline tailored to football match data. It will cover data ingestion, storage, training, model serving, and monitoring using AWS, Airflow, Redis, MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes, and other tools. I’ll also account for GDPR compliance and a two-person team, focusing on automation and scalability. I’ll get back to you shortly with the complete pipeline layout in markdown format.


# Overview

The goal is a fully automated football analytics ML pipeline that ingests match and player data, trains predictive models weekly, and serves real-time predictions to a commercial web app. Key components include data ingestion, a cloud data lake and relational store, feature engineering and caching, model training and registry, scalable model serving, monitoring, security, and CI/CD. This end-to-end pipeline ensures reproducible, low-latency scoring and regular retraining, using AWS services and tools like Airflow, MLflow, Docker/Kubernetes, Redis, Apache Arrow, and version control (DVC or CodeCommit) to manage data and model artifacts. Pipelines achieve reproducibility and automation, letting teams focus on new models rather than manual maintenance.

## Data Ingestion Layer

* **Weekly data fetch:** Use sports data APIs (e.g. [API-Football](https://www.api-football.com/) covers 1100+ leagues, players, and stats) or web scraping to retrieve new match results, odds, and player statistics every week.
* **Initial bulk data:** Load historical Kaggle datasets (e.g. European soccer database) via the Kaggle API. For example, an AWS Lambda or EC2 job can authenticate to Kaggle, download the dataset, and upload it directly to S3 without local storage.
* **Staging & formats:** Store raw JSON/CSV data temporarily on a local staging area or in-memory buffer. Immediately convert ingested data to an Apache Arrow columnar format for interoperability and speed, then upload to an S3 “raw” bucket. Arrow’s columnar, zero-copy format enables efficient analytical processing and seamless sharing between Python, Java, or C++ (e.g. Pandas and Spark).

## Data Storage Layer

* **S3 data lake:** All incoming raw data (from APIs, scraping, Kaggle) is landed in Amazon S3 (raw bucket). After cleaning/processing, refined datasets are saved to a separate S3 “processed” bucket. AWS S3 is ideal for storing vast amounts of structured and semi-structured data at low cost. The data lake design can be thought of as a lakehouse architecture: raw+processed files in S3, and a metadata/catalog layer on top (e.g. AWS Glue Catalog or OpenTable formats) for queries.
* **Metadata database (MariaDB):** Use MariaDB (e.g. AWS RDS) to store structured metadata – e.g. schema definitions, pipeline run logs, model performance stats, user account info, data access logs, etc. A relational DB enables fast SQL queries on metadata (e.g. who trained which model on which data) and ensures ACID compliance for critical records. (Per AWS MLOps best practices, MLflow or similar tools can use MySQL/PostgreSQL/MariaDB for tracking experiments.)
* **GDPR data governance:** Enforce data retention and deletion policies on S3 and MariaDB. As required by GDPR, delete or anonymize personal data (PII) when no longer needed. Store audit logs of data processing. Encrypt all data at rest (S3 encryption, EBS encryption, MariaDB encryption) and in transit (TLS for API calls). For example, AWS IAM, KMS, and enforced HTTPS ensure no plaintext PII is exposed. Implement “storage limitation” (don’t keep personal data longer than necessary) as per GDPR.

## Data Processing & Feature Engineering

* **Workflow orchestration (Airflow):** Use Apache Airflow to schedule and manage ETL/ELT tasks. A DAG runs weekly (and on-demand for minor updates) to extract data from S3, transform it, and load features. Airflow is the de-facto standard for ETL pipelines and can orchestrate arbitrary Python tasks (Arrow/Pandas) and ML jobs.
* **Processing environment:** Python scripts (or PySpark jobs) perform data cleaning and feature engineering. Pandas (with PyArrow) reads raw Arrow files, engineers features (rolling stats, dummy encoding, joins across tables, etc.), then writes feature tables back to S3 (as Parquet or Arrow). Using Arrow in-memory speeds up columnar ops and cross-language data transfer.
* **Feature caching (Redis):** Intermediate or real-time features (e.g. player form, team strength) are cached in Redis for quick access. Redis, an in-memory store, supports ultra-low-latency lookups, enabling sub-millisecond feature retrieval at inference time. For example, batch-computed features from the processed data can be bulk-loaded into Redis (online feature store) so the serving layer can fetch them instantly. Redis thus acts as the online feature store for live predictions.

## Model Training Pipeline

* **Weekly retraining:** Triggered by Airflow, the training DAG runs once per week on the updated feature dataset. Training scripts (in Python) use scikit-learn, XGBoost, or PyTorch to train predictive models (e.g. match outcome classifier, goal likelihood regressor, player performance models). Multiple models/hyperparams can be trained in parallel.
* **Experiment tracking (MLflow):** Log experiments and models with MLflow Tracking. Each training run records parameters, metrics, and artifacts (model files) in MLflow. (MLflow can integrate with Airflow via its provider.) Use MLflow’s model registry to tag the “production” model. Store model artifacts themselves in S3 or an S3-backed artifact store for versioning.
* **Version control:** All training code and small datasets/feature-engineering scripts are in Git. For large data files and model binaries, use DVC or AWS CodeCommit: DVC can version datasets and models on S3, while CodeCommit (or GitHub) stores code and configs. DVC captures “data versioning” so that each model is reproducible from specific data and code states. Tag each training run with the exact code/data commit IDs.
* **Artifact registry:** Trained models and feature schemas are versioned. For example, store model .pkl files or Torch checkpoints in S3 under versioned paths or via MLflow’s registry. Store feature definitions (e.g. Arrow schema) in MariaDB or a feature store catalog.

## Model Serving & Real-Time Inference

* **Containerized serving:** Package the trained model and inference code in a Docker image. Deploy the image to AWS EKS (Kubernetes). Use Kubernetes deployments and autoscaling to handle web traffic. Each container runs a FastAPI or Flask app exposing a REST endpoint for predictions. Docker/ECR ensures consistency; images are pulled from Amazon ECR. Kubernetes handles rolling updates and scaling.
* **Low-latency feature store:** At inference, the FastAPI code reads request input (e.g. upcoming match info) and fetches any required features from the online Redis feature store, then runs the model’s `.predict()` to generate outputs (win probability, expected goals, etc.). Redis ensures feature lookup in single-digit milliseconds, which is critical for real-time scoring.
* **REST endpoints:** The API provides JSON responses to the web app. E.g. endpoints like `/predict_match` return predicted scores/odds. Because models and feature retrieval are stateless within each container, inference scales horizontally across pods in the EKS cluster.

## Model Monitoring & Retraining Loop

* **Performance monitoring:** Instrument the serving stack with Prometheus to collect metrics (request latency, success rate, error rate, and prediction distributions). Grafana visualizes these dashboards. For example, track model drift: compare live input feature distributions to training baselines. When metrics breach thresholds (e.g. high latency or concept drift), alert and record the event.
* **Drift detection & alerts:** Use custom Prometheus rules (or integrate services like Evidently) to detect performance degradation. For instance, if model accuracy falls or input features drift, trigger an alert. Grafana dashboards provide real-time monitoring of business KPIs (prediction accuracy, usage).
* **Automated retraining:** Airflow periodically (or on drift triggers) launches the next training pipeline to refresh models. This closes the loop: new data → train → deploy. For example, a Grafana alert could trigger an Airflow DAG via a webhook to update the model on schedule or when needed.

## Security & Compliance

* **Access control (IAM):** Use AWS IAM roles and policies to enforce least-privilege access. Each component (EC2/EMR/Lambda, EKS pods, Airflow tasks) runs with an IAM role granting only needed permissions (e.g. “read S3 raw bucket, write processed bucket, read/write Redis, manage RDS” etc). Disable hard-coded credentials; use IAM OIDC for EKS and IAM roles for service accounts to grant pods S3/Redis access. Require MFA for human users.
* **Encryption:** Encrypt all storage. Enable S3 bucket encryption (AES-256 or KMS keys) for both raw and processed data. Enable MariaDB encryption at rest. Use TLS/HTTPS for data in transit (API endpoints, DB connections). For example, follow AWS best practices: “encrypting cloud storage buckets and databases … to mitigate risk of exposing personal data”. Use AWS KMS keys for any sensitive data.
* **GDPR compliance:** Anonymize or remove any personal player/fan data (e.g. names, IPs) early in ingestion. Apply data minimization – only keep necessary attributes. Maintain deletion logs: when user requests deletion, ensure the data is purged from both S3 and MariaDB, and log the event. Keep audit trails (CloudTrail) of data access. Adhere to “storage limitation” by scheduling regular purges of old data (e.g. archive or delete after 1 year).

## DevOps & CI/CD

* **Repository & automation:** Store all code (data pipelines, model code, infra manifests) in Git (e.g. GitHub or GitLab). Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to automate builds. On each commit or schedule, the CI pipeline runs tests, builds Docker images, and pushes them to Amazon ECR.
* **Infrastructure as code:** Keep Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, and Airflow DAGs in version control. Use GitOps practices: on merging to main, CI applies updated manifests to the EKS cluster (e.g. via `kubectl` or ArgoCD). Store Airflow DAGs and schedules in Git as well.
* **Continuous deployment:** For ML, use MLflow or script to promote models to production stage. For web/API services, automate rolling updates on EKS when new images are pushed. For schema changes, use migration tools (for MariaDB) tracked in Git. Regularly scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
