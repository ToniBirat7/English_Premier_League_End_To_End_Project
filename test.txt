Data ingestion is the process of bringing data from various sources into the system for further processing,
storage, and analysis. In this project, the ingestion process marks the beginning of the MLOps pipeline and
plays a critical role in ensuring the quality and structure of data used for training machine learning models and
conducting analytical tasks.
