    "\n",
    "services: # Define the services that make up your application\n",
    "  web: # Name of the service\n",
    "    image: nginx:latest # Use the latest Nginx image from Docker Hub\n",
    "    ports: # Map container ports to host ports\n",
    "      - \"80:80\" # Expose port 80 on the host to port 80 in the container\n",
    "    volumes: # Mount host directories or files into the container\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example of the Docker Compose file:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `version` specifies the syntax version of the Docker Compose file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `services` section defines two services: `web` and `db`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `web` service uses the Nginx image and maps port 80 of the host to port 80 of the container. It also mounts a local directory `./html` to the Nginx html directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Volume**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `volumes` section defines named volumes for persistent storage. In this example, for the `web` service, it mounts a local directory to the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which means that any files placed in the `./html` directory on the host will be served by Nginx.\n",
    "\n",
    "`./html:/usr/share/nginx/html` means that the local `html` directory is mapped to the Nginx html directory inside the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the directory `./html` should exist on the host machine, and this folder will be copied into the container at the specified path i.e. `/usr/share/nginx/html`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where as, `db_data:/var/lib/mysql` is a named volume that persists the MySQL database data across container restarts. This means that even if the MySQL container is stopped or removed, the data will still be available in the `db_data` volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alos, you can define volumes at the bottom of the Docker Compose file to create named volumes that can be reused across different services.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "volumes: # Define named volumes\n",
    "  db_data: # Named volume for MySQL data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This section allows you to define volumes that can be shared between services or used for persistent storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Networks**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also define networks in your Docker Compose file to allow services to communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that services can refer to each other by their service names, which Docker Compose automatically creates as DNS entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can define networks at the bottom of the Docker Compose file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "networks: # Define networks\n",
    "  my_network:\n",
    "    driver: bridge # Use the bridge driver for the custom network\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you can specify which network a service should use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "services:\n",
    "  web:\n",
    "    image: nginx:latest\n",
    "    ports:\n",
    "      - \"80:80\"\n",
    "    networks:\n",
    "      - my_network # Connect to the custom network\n",
    "  db:\n",
    "    image: mysql:5.7\n",
    "    environment:\n",
    "      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example\n",
    "    volumes:\n",
    "      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql\n",
    "    networks:\n",
    "      - my_network # Connect to the custom network\n",
    "volumes:\n",
    "  db_data: # Named volume for MySQL data\n",
    "networks: # Define networks\n",
    "  my_network: # Custom network for services to communicate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the `web` and `db` services to communicate with each other over the `my_network` network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Healthcheck**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add health checks to ensure that your services are running correctly. This can be done using the `healthcheck` key under a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "web:\n",
    "  image: nginx:latest\n",
    "  ports:\n",
    "    - \"80:80\"\n",
    "  healthcheck:\n",
    "    test: [\"CMD\", \"curl\", \"-f\", \"http://localhost/\"]\n",
    "    interval: 30s\n",
    "    timeout: 10s\n",
    "    retries: 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This health check will run every 30 seconds, trying to access the Nginx server. If it fails 3 times in a row, the service will be marked as unhealthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Build Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also build images from a Dockerfile using the `build` key. This allows you to specify the context and Dockerfile for building your service image.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "web:\n",
    "  build:\n",
    "    context: ./web\n",
    "    dockerfile: Dockerfile\n",
    "  ports:\n",
    "    - \"80:80\"\n",
    "db:\n",
    "  build:\n",
    "    context: ./db\n",
    "    dockerfile: Dockerfile\n",
    "  ports:\n",
    "    - \"3306:3306\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `web` service will build an image from the Dockerfile located in the `./web` directory, and the `db` service will do the same from the `./db` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also pass environment variables to your services using the `environment` key. This is useful for configuring your applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "db:\n",
    "  image: mysql:5.7\n",
    "  environment:\n",
    "    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example\n",
    "    MYSQL_DATABASE: mydb\n",
    "    MYSQL_USER: user\n",
    "    MYSQL_PASSWORD: password\n",
    "  ports:\n",
    "    - \"3306:3306\"\n",
    "  volumes:\n",
    "    - db_data:/var/lib/mysql\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the MySQL service is configured with a root password, a database name, a user, and a password for that user. These environment variables will be used by the MySQL container to set up the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "These variables are made available to the container at runtime, allowing you to configure your services dynamically. We can access these variables inside the container using the standard environment variable access methods in the programming language or framework being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In react, for example, you can access these environment variables using `process.env` in Node.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can use the `os.environ` dictionary to access these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependencies**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can specify dependencies between services using the `depends_on` key. This ensures that one service starts only after another service is ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "db:\n",
    "  image: mysql:5.7\n",
    "  environment:\n",
    "    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example\n",
    "  volumes:\n",
    "    - db_data:/var/lib/mysql\n",
    "  web:\n",
    "  image: nginx:latest\n",
    "  ports:\n",
    "    - \"80:80\"\n",
    "  depends_on:\n",
    "    - db # The web service depends on the db service\n",
    "  volumes:\n",
    "    - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html\n",
    "volumes: # Define named volumes\n",
    "  db_data: # Named volume for MySQL data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `web` service will wait for the `db` service to be ready before starting. This is useful when your web application depends on a database being available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command and EntryPoint**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can override the default command or entrypoint of a Docker image using the `command` and `entrypoint` keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "web:\n",
    "  image: nginx:latest\n",
    "  ports:\n",
    "    - \"80:80\"\n",
    "  command: [\"nginx\", \"-g\", \"daemon off;\"] # Override the default command\n",
    "  entrypoint: [\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\"] # Override the default entrypoint\n",
    "db:\n",
    "  image: mysql:5.7\n",
    "  environment:\n",
    "    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example\n",
    "  volumes:\n",
    "    - db_data:/var/lib/mysql\n",
    "  command: [\"mysqld\", \"--default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password\"] # Override the default command\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `web` service overrides the default command to run Nginx in the foreground, and the `db` service overrides the default command to use a specific authentication plugin for MySQL.\n"

    "## **Volumes and Networks**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Volumes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Volumes in Docker are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. They are stored outside the container filesystem, allowing data to persist even if the container is removed. Volumes can be shared between multiple containers, making them useful for sharing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we do not use volumes, any data created inside the container will be lost when the container is removed. This is particularly important for databases or applications that need to retain state.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, we can use volumes to store data outside the container's filesystem. This way, even if the container is removed, the data remains intact and can be reused by new containers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we use `postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data` in a Docker Compose file, it means that the PostgreSQL database `data` will be stored in a named volume called `postgres_data`. This volume can be reused by other containers or retained even if the PostgreSQL container is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, even if the PostgreSQL container is stopped or removed, the data in the `postgres_data` volume will still be available for future containers that use the same volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Volume Mounts**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of volume mounts in Docker:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bind Mounts**: These allow you to mount a specific file or directory from the host into the container. Changes made in the container will reflect on the host and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "volumes:\n",
    "  - ./data:/data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the `./data` directory on the host is mounted to the `/data` directory inside the container. Any changes made in either location will be reflected in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Named Volumes**: These are managed by Docker and can be shared between containers. They are stored in a specific location on the host, but you don't need to specify the exact path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "volumes:\n",
    "  - my_volume:/data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, `my_volume` is a named volume that Docker manages, and it will persist data even if the container is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Anonymous Volumes**: These are similar to named volumes but do not have a specific name. They are created when you specify a volume without a name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "volumes:\n",
    "  - /data\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Networks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Networks in Docker allow containers to communicate with each other. By default, Docker creates a `bridge` network for containers to connect to each other. However, you can create custom networks to control how containers interact.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we do not use networks, containers will not be able to communicate with each other unless they are on the same default bridge network. This can lead to issues when trying to connect services like web applications and databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of not using networks, if we have a web application container and a database container, they will not be able to communicate unless they are explicitly connected to the same network.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, we can create a custom network in Docker Compose. This allows us to define how containers communicate with each other and ensures that they can resolve each other's names.\n"
